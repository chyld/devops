How to backup dconf settings like keyboard shortcuts

Dump them all to a file:
dconf dump / >~/.config/dconf/user.conf
Open that file on a text editor and select the settings that you care about:

editor /tmp/dconf.conf
If you use Vim, you will want this syntax highlight.

You will soon ask yourself what is <Primary>.
If you don't know the name of the setting, but know how to modify it from a GUI like unity-control-center, run:

dconf watch /
and then modify them. The exact setting will then appear on the terminal.
When you want to restore those settings, run:
dconf load / <~/.config/dconf/user.conf
To finish things up, you can Git track that file to never lose it. https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick is my current favorite method.
